üóíÔ∏è **Week1_Threats**

**What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes?**
In order to protect myself from cybercrimes and other fishing threats, I have done the following things on perosonal level
1) Passwords
   √å have always tried to have my passwords as strong as possible to make it nearly impossible for someone to guess the password and after a month or two, I try to change the password
2) Two-Factor Authentication
   For most of the apps mostly for banking sites, I have enabled 2FA so in case someone have my password still will not be able to proceed without 2FA
3) Avoiding Public Shared Links
   Sometimes on media platforms some links are shared and they usually are phishing attacks, before clikcing on such urls, I always double check sites and their urls
4) Data-backup
   I always use cloud services to have backup data of the device in order to retrieve the data in case of any mishap 

I had not been a victim of such attacks but I always keep my eye on new news about security breaches and cases of cybercrime, I think it helped me a lot to avoid such attacks
